### Proxy Servers and Stay Anonymous
<br>

    Proxy server is a computer on a network which acts as an intermediary for connections with other computer on that network

 <!--from https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/proxy-server-->

A proxy server is a system or router that provides a gateway between users and the internet. Therefore, it helps prevent cyber attackers from entering a private network. It is a server, referred to as an “intermediary” because it goes between end-users and the web pages they visit online.

#### Used for 
1. *Keep the system behind the curtain (mainly for security resons)*
2. *Speed up the acces to a resource (through "cqching")*
3. *Speacialized proxy servers are used to filter unwanted content such as advertisements.*
4. *Proxy servers can be used as IP address multiplexer to enable to connect number of computers on the internet, whatever only has one IP address*

### **Vulnerability Scanning**
  vulnerability scanning is the procces of scanning/identifing existing vulnerabilities (you can also call it as loop hole) for the  the purpose of  exploiting or fixing the vulnerability 

  <details><summary> More Explenation: </summary>
  You can consider vulnerability as it's(Computer's) weakeness or just a flow in the code.
  </details>
 We use vulnerabilily scanner to order to scan for vulnerability in a system 

#### Scanners
Scanners are used to scan the system and identify the vulnerability , we also use scanner to check the open ports

**Eg :**

[`OpenVAS`](../Tools-Used/README.md#openvas) `


#### Common ports



### **Phishing**

*Phishing is a cybercrime in which a target or targets are contacted by email, telephone or text message by someone posing as a legitimate institution to lure individuals into providing sensitive data such as personally identifiable information, banking and credit card details, and passwords.

The information is then used to access important accounts and can result in identity theft and financial loss.*
